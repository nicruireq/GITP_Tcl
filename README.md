# GITP_Tcl
This repository holds two Tcl scripts for Xilinx Vivado:
* get_instantiation_template.tcl: generates VHDL instantiation templates from an entity in a .vhd source file.
* get_testbench_template.tcl: generates VHDL testbench skeleton from an entity in a .vhd source file.
Such scripts add to Vivado a set of features that were not included by Xilinx explicitly.
